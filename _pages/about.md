I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Dynamic Legged Systems lab, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia. My research focuses on Machine Learning methods and Optimal Control for robot locomotion. Before that, I graduated in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in 2018 at the La Sapienza University of Rome, and later that year, I started the PhD in Automatic Control, Bioengineering, and Operations Research, joining the DIAG Robotics Lab.
